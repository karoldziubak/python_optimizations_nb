# Python Performance Optimizations

A collection of examples, tricks and comparisons of code optimization techniques in Python. I focus on both speed, readability and memory consumption.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Get repo and create virtual environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karoldziubak/python_optimizations_nb.git
cd python_optimizations_nb
python -m venv .venv
```
### Activate virtual environment
For Unix/MacOs:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
For Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run notebook
- `examples/basics.ipynb` for basic Python optimizations with built-in functions showing performance gains with `%timeit`
- `examples/line_profiler.ipynb` for line-by-line profiling using `line_profiler` with case study based on optimization with `numpy` and `pandas` vectorization
